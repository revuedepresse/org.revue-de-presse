# Revue de presse contributing guidelines

### Welcome to our contributing guidelines!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to revue-de-presse.org.  
It's people like you who will make Revue de presse much better with each new contribution.

### Tell them why they should read your guidelines.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect   
the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.  
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in 
 - addressing your issue,  
 - assessing changes,
 - and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Kinds of contributions we are looking for

Revue de presse is an open source project and 
we love to receive contributions from our community — you!

There are many ways to contribute: 
 - from writing tutorials or blog posts,
 - improving the documentation,
 - submitting bug reports and feature requests or  
 - writing code which can be incorporated into Revue de presse components themselves.

### Contributions we are NOT looking for

Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions].  
If your problem is not strictly Revue de presse specific, Stack Overflow is worth considering.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that code meets all requirements i.e.  
  all tests suites pass
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.   
  Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible,  
  preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request?   
You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes!  
Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, Send a pull request.

## Small contributions

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, 
can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. 
As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like composer.json, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug

### How to communicate about security vulnerabilities?

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.   
Email security@revue-de-presse.org instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@revue-de-presse.org
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.   
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, 
just email us at security@revue-de-presse.org.

### How to file a bug report?

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions: 
1. What version of language runtime are you using (go version, clojure version, PHP version, node.js version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
   
### About feature request

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Revue de presse, you are probably not alone.   

There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. 
Many of the features that Revue de presse has today have been added because our users saw the need.  

Please open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which 
 - describes the feature you would like to see, 
 - why you need it,
 - and how it should work.
